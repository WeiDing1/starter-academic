  - description: I use MATLAB as my daily programming language, which is often used for the development of advanced numerical algorithms and figure generation. When it comes to computationally-heavy tasks, I typically use C/C++ to accelerate computation by leveraging the feature of compiled language as well as parallel computing techniques (such as MPI). Sometimes I also write Python codes to run machine learning tasks (I am not a fan of SciPy and that is why I use MATLAB much more than Python, but PyTorch is the best for machine learning tasks!).
    name: MATLAB, C/C++, Python
  - description: I am a fan of applied methematics, particularly of numerical methods for solving complex systems in practical engineering problems. My expertise about numerical methods is centered on the numerical evalution of fractional-order partial differential equations, or more generally, differ-integral type nonlocal systems. I am experienced in developing both effective and efficient numerical algorithms to solve, for example, fractional-order wave equations, by using finite difference and finite element approaches. Besides of numerical methods, I am also interested in large-scale scientific computing such as parallel computing.
