  - description: I am a fan of applied methematics, particularly of numerical methods for solving complex systems in practical engineering problems. My expertise about numerical methods is centered on the numerical evalution of fractional-order partial differential equations, or more generally, differ-integral type nonlocal systems. I am experienced in developing both effective and efficient numerical algorithms to solve, for example, fractional-order wave equations, by using finite difference and finite element approaches. Besides of numerical methods, I am also interested in large-scale scientific computing such as parallel computing.
    name: Numerical methods, Scientific computing
  - description: I use MATLAB as my daily programming language, which is often used for the development and prototyping of advanced numerical algorithms and figure generation. When it comes to computationally-heavy tasks, I typically use C/C++ to accelerate computation by parallel computing. I am also interested in machine learning techniques (with Python) and their applications in the area of mechanics.
    name: MATLAB, C/C++, Python
  - description: As a student majoring in mechanical engineering, my daily engineering software include mechanical design and prototyping software such as AutoCAD and Solidwork, and finite element software COMSOL.
