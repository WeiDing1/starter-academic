  - description: I use MATLAB as my daily programming language, which is often used for the development of advanced numerical algorithms and figure generation. When it comes to computationally-heavy tasks, I typically use C/C++ to accelerate computation by leveraging the feature of compiled language as well as parallel computing techniques (such as MPI). Sometimes I also write Python codes to run machine learning tasks (I am not a fan of SciPy and that is why I use MATLAB much more than Python, but PyTorch is the best for machine learning tasks!).
